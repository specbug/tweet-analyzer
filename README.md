# tweetAnalyzer
Android based app to search for live tweets using specific input handle and save the data in a text file.


##Overview

This is the code based on challenge for 'Learn Python for Data Science #2' by [llSourcell](https://github.com/llSourcell) on YouTube.
The code uses the tweepy library to access the Twitter API and the TextBlob library to perform Sentiment Analysis on each Tweet. We'll 
be able to see how positive or negative each tweet is about whatever topic we choose. The app is implemented on Kivy platform as it's 
written in Python.
